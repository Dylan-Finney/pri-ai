    Welcome: `üëã Welcome to the Private AI demo by Prifina!
This demo is designed to simulate having access to all of your personal data and information available in your private data cloud, along with data from various common applications and services typically used by consumers. This includes your emails, social media accounts, wearables, calendar, smart home devices, and other public data sources. By combining these sources, we're able to provide you with the best possible answers.
In addition, this demo utilizes application interfaces to interact with your applications and other external services, which means it can not only answer any question you may have, but it can also take any action you ask it to do. 
We've also customized this demo based on the personalization details you provided, so you can expect more relevant and personalized responses. 
So, go ahead and ask your first question! We're excited to show you how our Private AI demo can provide you with realistic answers and help simplify your life.`,
